I have authored and co-authored more than 70 articles (and counting â€¦). The following are some examples:



- [A Hard Look At Relativistic Reverberation in MCG-5-23-16 & SWIFT J2127.4+5654: Testing the Lamp-Post Model](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210304994Z/abstract)

>The data and codes used to produce the results are available [here](/relativistic-reverberation-in-mcg-5-23-16-and-swift-j127.4-5654).



- [Testing the Lamp-post and Wind Reverberation Models with XMM-Newton Observations of NGC 5506](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893...97Z/abstract)
