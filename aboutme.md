title: About me
---

I am an Astrophysicist and a Data Scientist who enjoys uncovering patterns in complex data.

My primary science focus is on studying black holes in the universe, how they work and how they influence they environment.
I develop algorithms and codes to analyze data from telescopes, and I speak `python`.

My technical expertise covers several domains, including:
- Time series.
- Stochastic modeling and forecasting.
- Numerical Optimization and Monte Carlo methods.
- Spectroscopy.
- Gaussian Processes.
- Machine learning.
