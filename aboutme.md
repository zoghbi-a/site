title: About me
---

I am an Astrophysicist and a Data Scientist who enjoys uncovering patterns in complex data.

My primary science focus is on studying black holes in the universe, how they work and how they influence their environment.

I develop algorithms and codes to analyze data from telescopes, mostly in `python`, but also in `C`, `C++` and others.

My technical expertise covers several domains, including:
- Time series.
- Stochastic modeling and forecasting.
- Numerical Optimization and Monte Carlo methods.
- Spectroscopy/Timing.
- Gaussian Processes.
- Machine learning.
